# Python-matplotlib-basics
Some basics of formatting graphs with matplotlib in Python using the axes objects (rather than the plt.plot shortcut).
The .py file is best used in Spyder but should work in general IDEs, the .ipynb file is for use in Jupyter notebooks.

Covers legends, plotting, axes labels, formatting the grid, ticks, tick labels.
Also color maps and sequential plotting, briefly mentions latex and f-strings, and a (very badly coded) 4 subplot figure.

This repository is meant to give an idea of the basics of what is possible with matplotlib, and is by no means complete, or factually verified. I am sure there are better and more efficient ways to do a lot of this.
However, it is heavily commented and should give beginners a place to start and ideas of what to Google.
I may add to it in future.
